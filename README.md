# Dice Simulator Readme

## Overview

The Dice Simulator is a simple Python program that simulates the roll of a six-sided dice. It generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays a graphical representation of the corresponding dice face. Users can continue rolling the dice as many times as they like and choose to exit the simulator when they are done.

## Usage

To use the Dice Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the "dice_simulator.py" file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the "dice_simulator.py" file is located.

5. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```
   python dice_simulator.py
   ```

6. The program will display a welcome message and the graphical representation of a randomly rolled dice face.

7. You can choose to continue rolling the dice or exit the simulator:

   - Type '1' and press Enter to roll the dice again.
   - Type '2' and press Enter to exit the simulator.

## Dice Art

The program uses ASCII art to represent the different dice faces. Each face of the dice is represented as a series of lines and dots. Here are the representations for each number:

1:
```
┌─────────┐
│         │
│    ●    │
│         │
└─────────┘
```

2:
```
┌─────────┐
│  ●      │
│         │
│      ●  │
└─────────┘
```
